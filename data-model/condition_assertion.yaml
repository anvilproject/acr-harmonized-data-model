      Condition Code should be from one of a recognized ontology. Multiple codes can be indicated, but should simply be alternative encodings for the same entity such as alternates encodings from other ontologies.       
      Recommended ontologies include: SNOMED_CT, HP, OMIM and ORPHA and coded with the corresponding curies
      * SNOMED : https://bioregistry.io/registry/snomedct
      * HP : https://bioregistry.io/registry/hp
